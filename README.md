# Overview

This is a simple CLI Java application, that simulates the computer shop with a couple of computers
in stock.

Upon launching the application by starting the main method
in the [Main class](/src/main/java/org/shop/Main.java), the application will
print the information about all the available in the shop computers, with their position numbers,
and will ask the user to enter the position of the computer the user would like to buy, or 0, to buy
neither of them.

The program will process the user's choice and will print the information about the computers that
are left in stock afterwards.

The output example can be found in the output example [file](output_example.txt).
